# Multi Heddle Loom

## Design Process
I was inspired by the simplicity of the loom designs of the master woodworking writer Franklin H. Gottshall and intended to design with the minimum possible pieces. A frame loom was reimagined to fit the table considering the size and movements of a laptop. The modularity of design was also a major concern as I intend to add the electronic functionality later on. The initial designs were created for wood with thickness between 8-12 mm and were intended to be cut on a milling machine. Mr. Jogin Francis, my fabacademy instructor at Superfablab, Kerala supported me in this endeavour. A version for 4mm craft Plywood that can be laser cut was made and prototyped in Fablab Barcelona on December 12, 2022. The electronic integration and user interface are developed under the mentorship of Professor Philip Heidkamp, Chair Interface / Interaction Design at KÃ¶ln International School of Design. The name Indira is synonymous with wealth and is an anagram of the names of my parents.

## Outcome
The loom was made by students in 2 design colleges in India.
It won the Design Culture Awards at Pink city Design confluence, Jaipur under Professional Category.
The loom was selected by Not Just a Collective in Arnhem, Netherlands to be displayed at their collective.
The loom was featured in the [Distributed Design Book 2023 edition - Driving design](https://distributeddesign.eu/resources/driving-design-book/)
